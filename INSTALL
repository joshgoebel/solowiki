== Getting started

1. modify config/database.yml for your setup (defaults to sqlite3)
2. rake db:schema:load (to load the database)
3. edit app/model/user.rb to set a password that will determine who can edit your wiki
4. script/server (or mongrel_rails start)
5. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and see your shiny new solowiki

== About TiddlyWiki changes

SoloWiki sports numerous changes and additions to TiddlyWiki 1.2.29 including:

* ServerSide support (of course!)
* Context sensitive help when editing special pages
* Real-time to-do lists
* Public and private pages
* I forget the rest, honestly
* "Tiddlers" => "Pages"
* Textile support
* Drag and drop re-ordering of pages
* SortableGrid

== How is SoloWiki different than ServerSideWiki?

1. No sub-domain or multiple account support.
2. No account settings panel and only the default blue CSS theme.

== How can I use SoloWiki to support multiple users editing the wiki?

1. Each user logs in with the shared password
2. Go into the wiki control panel
3. Select the Options tab
4. Change the "Sign edits as:" name for each user

Note: These settings are preserved with a cookie, so as long as the two users are on different computers, or different accounts on the same computer this should work just fine.

== Other notes

Enjoy.
